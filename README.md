# js_nvim_confs
My confs for neovim


Sup. I will inevitably brick my system or get fed up with using the default
config on a VM one day, so here's my init.vim

Features:
Transparent background so you can use a dropdown terminal
Italics for function defs and comments
The sexiest theme in the history of vim
Syntax highlighting
The only good leader key ("," of course)
